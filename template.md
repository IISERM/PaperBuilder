### Codeblocks

```
Long, single-line code blocks will not wrap. IT WILL OVERFLOW. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
You can also add the code language like I put python below. It adds syntax coloring too! But it doesn't RUN it. You can also paste ipynb exported as latex
```

```python
def func(x1, x2):
    return x1+x2
func(3+4) == 7
```

Add a final empty section called # References. Pandoc will append your references here.

Add a pagebreak before References for best results!

$\pagebreak$
