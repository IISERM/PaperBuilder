# PaperBuilder

Build a latex paper with IISER Mohali logo and superb formatting with just Markdown

## WTF is markdown?

Markdown is a very simplistic markup language. Much like html, but WAAAAY easier.
Want to add a heading? No big deal! Just do `# h1` or `## h2` or ... Want to add that lovely plot you made? Do `![Image caption](image path)`. A link? `[Link caption](url)`. But what about MATH? Just use `$y = \sin(t)$` or `$$y = \sin(t)$$` in a new line. Tables, in-page links, text formatting, heck even code! Everything can be written in markdown. Let me let you in on a secret! This very page you are reading is actually in Markdown.

Following are some guides -

- [Introductory cheat sheet](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
- [A complete documentation](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html#pandocs-markdown)

For most purposes, the cheat sheet will be enough.

## Why can't I just directly use Latex?

Why not Latex directly? Because it is 202x! No one should be writing stuff directly in LaTeX. Fancy Machine Learning or Artificial Intelligence or whatever should convert it exactly the way I want it. We aren't there yet, but this is one step better. This lets you focus on the content, and the Pandoc and the template takes care of making it seem like you know a lot to your professors.

Also, Markdown is a great way to take quick notes during lectures and talks. Now you don't have rewrite it in Latex and worry about Latex syntax anymore

## That's cool, show me how it looks!

We have a minimal example in the [Examples Page](./examples). Be sure to check it out!

Look at the [Installation](./installation) and the [Usage](./usage) pages for a manual.

## I have a MUCH better template

We'd LOVE to add more templates. Make a template according to pandoc's rules, and send in a PR. Don't know what any of this is? That's ok, share an Overleaf or some such template which we'll try to add if we like it and have time!

## I Wanna contribute too!

See the [devdocs](./devdocs)

## WOW! SUCH A SUPERB TEMPLATE! WHO MADE IT?

Why, thanks! Mayukh Chakrabarty of MS18 made this template, all credits to him. Tailoring it to use with pandoc was done by Dhruva Sambrani. Drop in a thanks to Dhruva @ ms18163 or Mayukh @ ms18046
